Hello World
===========

This is a demonstration of issues with local package references used with `--index-url`. It relies on the changes in this branch of briefcase (https://github.com/sarayourfriend/briefcase/tree/add/extra-index-url) which add support for `repository_url` and `extra_repository_urls`.
